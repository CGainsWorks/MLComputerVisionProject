Uni stuff

In the zip folder, please unzip folder into linux environment. Then follow the README.txt on how to run the program. I have split each point on the Req. No. on markscheme to have a program for each point (8 Tasks - 8 Programs - 8 Points). Please run each program individually, following instructions. 
Folder structure - cvprlab > CourseworkRelated > coursework > Task (1-8). Please check path and descriptors are made if any errors (Follow README_HOW_TO_RUN_PROGRAM.txt). I have not had much page space left for photos so report is mainly text and results.
